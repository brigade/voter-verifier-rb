# USPS Suffix Abbreviations

# I try to put the most-likely-ambiguous term first, in case an instance of
# it doesn't really mean those other terms. When expand=false, all the
# rightward terms get turned into the first term. That way, we don't have
# st turning into street all the time, even when it means saint. This
# may not matter at all. Think about it when awake.
